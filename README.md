Example:

  azshell -t a21a8321-8bcc-4c65-1106-3432b1da0bb2b -c 1234df7b-efd2-113e-ca51-hdaf1ded2bas -p "DAS1~XZQ~zwd..."
```
## Installation

```
pip install azshell
azshell -h
```
Or
```
git clone https://github.com/vifreex/AzShell.git
cd AzShell
pip install .
azshell -h
```

## Authentication

To perform authentication, the tenant name or tenant ID must be specified. If authentication is to be done using the tenant ID, it can be retrieved as follows:

- `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<DOMAIN>/.well-known/openid-configuration`
- `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT NAME>.onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`

Authentication will obtain one token for **Microsoft Graph API** and another for **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**. The access token will be used to interact with both APIs.

_If the **--onlygraph** flag is set, only a token for the Graph API will be requested, and no token for the ARM API will be obtained._

Token caching is managed automatically by AzShell, and if any token expires, it will attempt to renew it using the appropriate `refresh_token`.

### Username and password

```
azshell -t example.com -u geralt@example.com
```

Username and password authentication uses a device code. This method allows you to access via a browser and enter the device code displayed by AzShell, enabling authentication with a password, or directly using cookies. It also supports authentication processes that involve ADFS or third-party authentication providers.

**The steps performed by AzShell to obtain the tokens are as follows:**

1. A token for Microsoft Graph is requested, and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` are saved in a `.token_graph_data` file.
2. The `refresh_token` is used to request a token for Azure Resource Manager (ARM), and the `access_token` and `refresh_token` are saved in a `.token_arm_data` file.
3. The user's context is generated using both tokens (the tokens are validated)."

### Client Application ID and secret

```
azshell -t example.com -c 1234df7b-efd2-113e-ca51-hdaf1ded2bas -p "DAS1~XZQ~zwd.SsdvyEeM0eSDT"
```

When using Client ID and Secret for authentication, AzShell directly requests tokens for Microsoft Graph and Azure Resource Manager (ARM). 

**The steps performed by AzShell to obtain the tokens are as follows:**

1. A token for Microsoft Graph is requested, and the `access_token` is saved in a `.token_graph_data` file.
2. A token for Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is requested directly, and the `access_token` is saved in a `.token_arm_data` file.
3. The application context is generated using both tokens (the tokens are validated).

### Refresh token

```
azshell -t example.com -r "0.AQUAktgDm4z-BU6A8TLpKKFroliiUBl7IjFOqc9xdJ..."
```

Using the provided refresh token, AzShell will attempt to request the necessary tokens for the Microsoft Graph API and the Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

### Access token (Only Graph)

```
azshell -t example.com -a "eyJ0eXAdssAJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6Inl2Q242sZsdfLC..."
```

Using the provided access token, AzShell will retrieve the token's context, which includes details about the token itself and the associated permissions. This functionality is specifically available when using a Microsoft Graph API access token.
